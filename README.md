# Intro

This is my implementation of the Print.com frontend code challenge. This is by no means a production ready application, but simply a runthrough of some aspects of building frontends, for example;

- Component structuring
- Basic UI library usage
- Store and state management
- Test driven development

## Steps

The following was implemented within a a timespan of 6-7 hours.

O Boilerplate
O Product overview
O Product selection page
O Product exclude logic
O Products store
O Cart store
O Print.com styling
O Unit tests
O Quality fixes

To improve the UX, and provide more of a wow-factor, I'd like to implement

O AI translation module
O Loading screen
O Optimise performance

## Getting started

To test the project for yourself, you'll need NodeJS and a local browser.

1. `cd ./print-product`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Visit the url with the port returned in the terminal

A more extensive document can be found in the `./print-product` folder.
